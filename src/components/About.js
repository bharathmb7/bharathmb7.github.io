                <p>If I could describe myself in a sentence, that would be <b>'open to learning'</b>.  I am an undergrad student studying computer science. I am well versed in front-end web development. And now I am fairly intrigued by blockchain technology and I believe itâ€™s the next big thing. I wish to learn more about it and advance to web3.</p>
